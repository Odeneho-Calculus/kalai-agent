# KalAI Agent

KalAI Agent is a next-generation AI coding assistant extension for Visual Studio Code, designed to empower developers with real-time code editing, intelligent suggestions, and conversational support.

## Features

- üß† **AI Chat Interface**: Context-aware conversational assistant embedded directly in the VS Code sidebar to answer questions, explain code, suggest solutions, and generate snippets in multiple languages.

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Inline Code Editing**: Smart "edit with AI" functionality allows users to highlight code and instruct KalAI Agent to refactor, optimize, document, or rewrite it instantly.

- üóÇÔ∏è **Multi-file Awareness** (Planned): Experimental ability to scan and understand relationships across multiple open files to provide smarter suggestions.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **No API Key Required**: Unlike commercial tools, KalAI Agent is powered by a freely available, local or cloud-hosted AI model (e.g., Meta's Code Llama or OpenRouter access to Mixtral/Zephyr) ‚Äî removing the need for paid APIs or authentication.

## Quick Start
