workbench.desktop.main.js:sourcemap:518 [Extension Host] Sending response: Hello! I see you're working with the Kal Vue UI extension codebase. Based on the repository analysis and the code I've examined, I can help you with several areas.

Looking at your project structure, I notice you have:

1. **High complexity functions** that could benefit from refactoring (highlightUpdate, getComponentHierarchy, parseTemplateHierarchy)
2. **TypeScript global type definitions** that may need optimization
3. **Component architecture** that follows Vue patterns but has maintainability concerns

Would you like me to help you with any specific aspect? For example:

- **Refactor the complex functions** into smaller, more maintainable pieces
- **Optimize the TypeScript global types** for better performance and type safety
- **Review the component hierarchy parsing** for potential issues
- **Improve the VS Code extension architecture** for better extensibility

What would you like to focus on first? (at console.<anonymous> (file:///c:/Users/kalculusGuy/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/workbench/api/node/extensionHostProcess.js:166:31057))
